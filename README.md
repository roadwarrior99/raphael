## AWS Setup
### It is ideal to create an IAM user for Raphael bot to use with the permissions listed below. No Console access should be given to this user.
### AWS CLI User permissions required:
- AmazonPollyReadOnlyAccess
- AmazonTranscribeFullAccess
- SecretsManagerReadWrite
#### Access to secrets manager should be restricted to the raphael-bot arn.

## No passwords should ever be stored in code or config files with this project.
### AWS Secret Manager - secret setup.
The following key / values pairs will need to be manually created in a secret called "raphael-bot".
The name of the secret that it looks for is configurable in the config.yml file.
- TwitchNickName
- TwitchPassword (oauth, not user)
- OpenAIUserName
- OpenAIOrganizationID
- OpenAIKey
- OpenAIProjectID
- ObsStudioServerKey

# Local Raphael Configuration
## config.yml should have all user configurable settings for raphael.

### Change these settings to your Twitch user name:
- twitch_irc_channel (Where Raphael should respond to questions)
- twitch_channel_url (Left over from when we were trying to pull audio from twitch rather than lcoal)
- obs_scene_keywords "Scene Name": "What to listen for"
